Week 1 - Creation
 - App that synchronously shows a UITableView of fake news articles
 
 - Fork the git repo and clone it onto your machine
 - Open Xcode
 - Create new Project as Single View App
 - Run it
 - Add a label with your name in it in Storyboard
 - Run it -> Your name is in the app!
 - Now add the data fetcher file + data struct to xcode project
 - Add label to the ViewController file
 - Make the label show the first entry from the data fetcher
 - Run it -> it doesn't show the first entry from the data fetcher. :_(
 - Connect the label to the IBOutlet
 - Run it -> it shows the first news article!
 - Replace label with a UITableView in Storyboard
 - Add a UITableViewDataSource
 -- Connect the data source to data fetcher (number of items, empty cells)
 - Run it -> It shows the right number of cells!
 - Populate the cell with info from data fetcher
 - Run it -> It shows the data in a table view. :tada:
